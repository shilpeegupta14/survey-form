# survey-form

Due to current pandemic it has been difficult to physically contact people ywt difficult times bring the best in us and rediscover our hidden potentials.

This is a survey volunteer form that anyone can fill in order to support our community.

According to NHS officials, OVER 4,00,000 people joined the NHS volunteer program in one day to rebuild the community and bring back the lost camaraderie in times of crisis.

which clearly reflects that goodness within the community still persists and will continue to persist.
