    <p id="description">Due to current pandemic, many of us have lost lives and many of us have have been left with the painful yet loving memories of our beloved ones. We as a part of NHS community are always there for you and will always  be with you, through your thick and thin. But this wont be possible without the combined efforts of you all. Lets join this league of helping others and helping ourselves. Below is the form for volunteering. Though as a part of community, you all will be serving to many. Thus maintaining 6 feet distance and sanitisation should be kept in mind.Kindly refrain from participating in volunteer programs if you are immuno-compromised. WE LOVE OUR COMMUNITY BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF ANYONE'S HEALTH. Though there are many ways in which we can contribute for the well-being of our community.</p>
